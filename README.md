A summary of the 22nd International Solving Contest (ISC) held worldwise on 25-Jan-2026.
It can be viewed at https://nshram.github.io/ISC-2026/

This webpage shows the results of the 3 categories in separate tabs.
In each tab, the rows can be filtered based on values in one or more columns.

The ISC Rank is shown in the penultimate column.
The revised rank for the filtered rows is shown in the last column.

A lower time value is used to tiebreak scores that are equal.
If the times are also the same, then the ranks are shared.

This can be used, for example, to get:
1. Rankings for a particular country
2. Rankings for a particular location
3. Rankings for Junior women
Etc.

The data at https://solving.matplus.net/isca has been used.
