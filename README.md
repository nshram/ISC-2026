A summary of the International Solving Contest (ISC) held worldwise on 25-Jan-2026.
This webpage shows the results of the 3 categories in separate tabs.
In each tab, the rows can be filtered based on values in one or more columns.
The ISC Rank is shown in the penultimate column.
The revised rank for the filtered rows is shown in the last column.
A lower time value is used to tiebreak scores that are equal.
If the times are also the same, then the ranks are shared.
